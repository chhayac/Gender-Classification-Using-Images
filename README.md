# Placeholder repository for Gender Classification Using Images
I will be uploading the code once my finals are finished

## Deep-Learning
Gender Prediction from Social Media profile pictures using deep learning

## Goal
To predict gender of 9500 facebook users using images as source. I used profile.csv data to separate data into male and female folders as Keras expected

## Libraries used
Keras with tensorflow as backend

## Strategy
Fine-tuned VGG16 ImageNet model for the binary classification task. The method is called Transfer Learning.
